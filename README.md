# (WIP) `bookmark2obsidian`

A tool for converting browser bookmarks into Obsidian-flavored Markdown.

Very much a work-in-progress as of 2025-03-05.

## Motivation

I rarely return to or utilize my browser bookmarks after adding them, at best they help populate my search suggestions. I wanted to make it easier to browse and curate my bookmarks without having to build an entirely new user-interface/system for managing them, sticking to plain-text/human-readable records where possible. Naturally, this led me to consider Obsidian for the job.
